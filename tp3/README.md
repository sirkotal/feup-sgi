## Project Information

- The goal of this project was to develop a small 3D game, consisting of a race on a user-controlled hot air balloon, following certain requirements.

## Issues/Problems

- Defining the limits of our track proved challenging due to its geometry. Additionally, the balloon collision with the track relies on the player balloon's hitbox rather than its shadow.
- The game has some limitations resulting from restrictive design choices mandated by the project requirements.
- Sometimes there were questions about how to approach certain areas of the project due to some ambiguity regarding the requirements.
